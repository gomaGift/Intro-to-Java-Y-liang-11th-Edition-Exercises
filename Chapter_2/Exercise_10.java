 * (Science: calculating energy) 
 * Write a program that calculates the energy needed to heat water from an initial temperature to a final temperature.
 * Your program should prompt the user to enter the amount of water in kilograms and the initial and final temperatures of the water.
 * The formula to compute the energy is Q = M * (finalTemperature â€“ initialTemperature) * 4184
 * where M is the weight of water in kilograms, initial and final temperatures are in degrees Celsius, and energy Q is measured in joules.
